# Stylish-Name
This is a simple tool created by me in just 5 minutes and by the way this is a  part of my python practice.

Uses:

git clone https://github.com/MrSp4rX/Stylish-Name.git

cd Stylish-Name

python3 main.py

Enter Your Name  

After getting your Name in another format just copy it and Paste it.
